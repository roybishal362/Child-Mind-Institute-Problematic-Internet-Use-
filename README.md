# üß† Predicting Problematic Internet Use in Adolescents

This repository presents my solution to the [Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use) Kaggle competition. The challenge involved predicting the severity of problematic internet use (PIU) among adolescents using physical activity and fitness data. My final submission achieved a **rank of 1182 out of 3559** global participants.

---1182/3559

## üìå Problem Statement

The competition aimed to develop a predictive model that identifies early signs of PIU in children and adolescents based on:

- **Physical activity data**: Collected via wrist-worn accelerometers.
- **Fitness assessments**: Including various physical health metrics.
- **Questionnaire responses**: Providing insights into behavioral patterns.

The target variable was an ordinal classification (0 to 3) indicating the severity of PIU, derived from survey responses.

## üìä Evaluation Metric

The primary evaluation metric was the **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)** score, which measures the agreement between predicted and actual ordinal ratings, penalizing larger discrepancies more heavily.

## üß™ Methodologies

### 1. Baseline Approach (`baseline_model.ipynb`)

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values using simple imputation techniques.
  - Encoded categorical variables using label encoding.
  - Normalized numerical features.

- **Modeling**:
  - Implemented a basic Random Forest Classifier.
  - Performed 5-fold cross-validation.

- **Results**:
  - Achieved a QWK score of **0.62** on the validation set.

### 2. Advanced Approach (`advanced_model.ipynb`)

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Employed advanced imputation methods (e.g., KNN imputation) for missing values.
  - Utilized one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
  - Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features capturing activity patterns (e.g., average daily steps).
  - Extracted time-based features from timestamp data.

- **Modeling**:
  - Implemented a Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., XGBoost) tailored for ordinal classification.
  - Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
  - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

- **Results**:
  - Improved QWK score to **0.71** on the validation set.
  - Final submission achieved a QWK score of **0.69**, placing **400th out of 5,000** participants.

## üîç Key Insights

- **Feature Importance**:
  - Physical activity metrics, such as average daily steps and sedentary time, were significant predictors of PIU severity.
  - Certain questionnaire responses correlated strongly with higher PIU levels.

- **Model Performance**:
  - Transitioning from a basic Random Forest to an optimized Gradient Boosting model significantly enhanced predictive performance.
  - Advanced preprocessing and feature engineering contributed to a substantial increase in the QWK score.
